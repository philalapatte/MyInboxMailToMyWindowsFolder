# MyInboxMailToMyWindowsFolder
A small vba macro once executed will take my mails (first it asks for outlook forder) 
nd make a backup of each in a windows folder with date and time stamp.

The goal is for example when you archive a folder concerning a trip with your travel documents, 
you can easeliy add all the mails you had concening this event/trip.
As the name of the mails are renamen with date and time in front they will appear nicely
in order in the archive folder.
